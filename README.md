   The stock market is much like a living, breathing thing, as it represents the capriciousness of humans in a statistical form, rising and falling much as human emotions do. These fluctuations are impossible to predict--you can’t perform psychoanalysis on a stock ticker--but we can at least try. This program performs a technical analysis on historical stock data using the Tensorflow.js library to model and predict the stock’s future value.
